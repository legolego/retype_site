# Hello!

![](static/AboutHeader.png)

I am a data scientist, whose recent education along with inventive mindset combine with a desire to research unfamiliar topics in order to communicate knowledge discovery. The ability to recognize needed enhancements in user experience and paying attention to details brings an additional valuable skillset.

This is a slightly curated site for my projects, that should be easier to navigate than my github [repository](https://github.com/legolego).

More about my experience can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olegnikolsky/)
