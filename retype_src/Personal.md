## This Retype site
You can make this site yourself with [Retype](https://retype.com/), code is [here](https://github.com/legolego/retype_site). The navigation is built-in and it's all done with markdown.


## Temperature Records over time
[![](static/TemperatureRecords02.png)](https://github.com/legolego/WeatherRecords)
This was my first real attempt at using Jupyter notebooks, and I decided to see if I could find how many new high and low temperature records were being set over time.


## Attempts at Advent of Code
Really good practice from a couple years ago, my attempts [here](https://github.com/legolego/adventofcode2020).

## PyWekaBayes

This is a simple [project](https://github.com/legolego/PyWekaBayes) showing how in Python to call the BayesNet classifier provided by Weka. A relevant Google Groups discussion is [here](https://groups.google.com/g/python-weka-wrapper/c/qF4vw_6sqAA/m/EmqTph1NAAAJ)
